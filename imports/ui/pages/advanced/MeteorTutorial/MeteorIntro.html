This tutorial will show you how to create a FHIR based web application that reads, writes, updates, and deletes FHIR resources from a remote server. The application we will build is a simple patient task manager. Essentially this is a "To-Do" list for a healthcare provider to keep track of all the tasks needed in the care of a patient.

The FHIR resources used in this application are:
* Patient
* CarePlan

To make creation of this web app easier we are using the open-source web framework, MeteorJS. Meteor simplifies creation of web based tools by supplying a robust premade client-server infrastructure that allows us to focus on creating, manipulating, and displaying data (the fun stuff).

While this tutorial is intended to be used by anyone, regardless of programming background, it may be helpful to start by doing the "To Do" tutorial on the Meteor website (link here). The Meteor tutorial does go more in depth into the capabilities of Meteor then is needed for his tutorial, but also gives a good overview of the basic concepts and components of the framework.

All together, this tutorial consists of 205 lines of code (including some spaces), and we will build the app piece by piece.

### A note on coding style:

This app was created puposefully to be in a single HTML file. One of Meteor's strengths is its templating engine, which we are not making use of for the sake of simplicity. The goal of this tutorial is the use of FHIR, rather than using Meteor. Also, I don't use ending semi-colons - because they are not needed in JavaScript, and tabs, not spaces. :)
