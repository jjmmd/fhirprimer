		<p>In this tutorial we are going to construct a very basic FHIR based web application that will load a list of patients and display demograpihc information about a selected patient.</p>

		<p>While no formal computer programming experience is needed, some familiarity with HTML and JavaScript will be beneficial. Creating a single page HTML and JavaScript FHIR application presents a few challenges. The webpage will be requesting information from a remote FHIR server. Depending on the FHIR server and web browser used when following this tutorial, things may not work as expected due to security settings.</p>

		<br>

		<ul><b>You will need three things to complete this tutorial:</b>
			<li>Text Editor</li>
			<li>Web Browser (Google Chrome recommended)</li>
			<li>FHIR Server to talk to (SIIM Hackathon Server recommended)</li>
		</ul>
		
		<br>

		<p>Open your favorite text editor or development environment and create a blank document called "HelloPatient.html". Save this file in an easily accessible location such as your desktop.</p>
