	<!-- # Where to begin?

	Imagine you work in a hospital Emergency Room and a new patient arrives with a broken arm. The patient will be entered into the electronic health record, checked into an examination room, seen by a nurse and physician, sent to radiology for an x-ray, have the bone put in a cast by an orthopedist, scheduled for a follow-up clinic appointment, and finally discharged home with a prescription for pain medication. At each step in this process information is created and exchanged between physicians, nurses, clinics, and hospital departments. -->

# How to use this website?

This website is intended to give users a basic understanding of what FHIR is and how it works. With that foundation, users will then be able to experiment with building a FHIR query and a basic web based FHIR application, "Hello Patient!". Advanced lessons will dive deeper into web application development with FHIR, including SMART on FHIR security with OAuth2, and leave users with a boilerplate template to begin experimenting on their own.
